# User Manager

A simple browser-based user management tool built with plain JavaScript and Bootstrap. Add, edit, delete, and manage users — all stored locally in your browser.

---

## Overview

This project lets you:
- Add new users with email, first name, last name, and a custom count.
- Increment or decrement user counts.
- Edit existing user details.
- Delete individual users.
- Clear all users, half the list, or just the last entry.
- See live stats for added, edited, and deleted users.

Everything works with `localStorage` — no backend required.
